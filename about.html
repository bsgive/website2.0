                <h1>About Me:</h1>
                <p>Hi, I’m Ben Givens, a software engineer from Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. 
                    I focus on designing and building efficient, user-focused applications that combine clean code with modern technologies. 
                    My goal in every project is to create software that is not only functional but also intuitive and impactful for those who use it.</p>

                <p>Outside of coding, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest tools, frameworks, and industry trends. 
                I enjoy connecting with other professionals in the field, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on projects that challenge me to grow while making a meaningful difference.</p>
                <p>When I am not immersed in coding projects, I spend time enjoying the outdoors in the beautiful Northwest, whether hiking, exploring nature, or simply appreciating the scenery. 
                I am also passionate about giving back to my community, which I do through volunteering at our local soup kitchen.</p>
                <p> My moto is that there is no problem that cannot be solved with teamwork, peristence, and dedication. </p>
