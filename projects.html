                <h3>Education – Associate of Science, North Idaho College:</h3>
                <p> I earned my Associate of Science degree from North Idaho College, 
                where I built a strong foundation in mathematics, problem-solving, and logical thinking. My coursework introduced me to the 
                fundamentals of computer science and technical communication, both of which have been crucial in shaping my interest in technology. 
                This experience not only gave me academic knowledge but also taught me how to approach challenges methodically, work effectively in teams, and continually adapt to new concepts. 
                It was here that I gained the confidence and discipline to pursue a career in software development.</p>
                <h3>Work Experience – Manager at Pilgrim’s Market:</h3>
                <p>I spent three years working as a manager at Pilgrim’s Market, where I developed valuable leadership and organizational skills.
                In this role, I managed teams, coordinated daily operations, and focused on creating a productive and supportive work environment.
                The position required strong communication skills and the ability to resolve problems quickly while balancing customer satisfaction and business needs.
                My time at Pilgrim’s Market also taught me how to prioritize responsibilities, manage deadlines, and adapt to the fast-paced demands of retail management. 
                These skills continue to influence my work today, especially when coordinating projects and collaborating with others in the software engineering field</p>
                <h3>Technical Work – Coding Projects and Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>Alongside my professional and academic experiences, I have spent significant time solving coding problems and working on projects that challenge my ability to think logically and creatively.
                These experiences have allowed me to become proficient in multiple programming languages, strengthen my understanding of algorithms, and refine my approach to debugging and troubleshooting.
                I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and finding efficient, reliable solutions. Each project I’ve worked on has given me new insights into best practices, from writing clean, maintainable code to optimizing performance. 
                This ongoing work has fueled my passion for software development and continues to drive my growth in the field.</p>
